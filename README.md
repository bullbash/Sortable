# Sortable
Challenge

Here is a suggested solution for the Sortable.com coding challenge:
I employ a Java implementation of simplified *perceptron* with single layer of receptors.
The idea is to create a set of those receptors (and such to define the neural network topology) 
by using the UI parameters: 
<br>"Dendrite Size" - maximum number of consecutive symbols *felt* by a single neuron's dendrite
<br>"Dendrites Number" - a number of dendrites of a neuron (a number of symbols' sequences) contributing to a neuron excitement
<br>"Dendrites Spread" - a max number of symbols apart between a neuron dendrtites
Note: it all could be described without fancy NN terminology - in terms of just symbols sequences.

Button "Start" starts the comparison of a *Product Name* to each *Listing name* from given files in *Home directory*.
Comparison measure is calculated in processors.Worker.getMetrics() method.
Currently it calculates a number of equal symbol sequences for given *Product:product_name* and *Listing:title* only.
Leaves *a lot* of room for fine tuning.

Suggested solution is a cut out from multi-layered NLP social news parser working with *much* longer pieces. 
I make no assumption on the nature of studied sequences - could be string of any human language as well as
market behavior, digitized sounds and such.

Test runs showed:
More complex NN topologies result in increased classification precision with greater processing times.
To optimize one must know acceptable precision/computational price levels.

The resulting file in *Home directory* is results[topology].txt file. I slightly changed requested output format to
better illustrate *similarity metric*  relevancy of different NN topologies and reduce the output file size.

Could be a start for further improvements.
